# Udacity-CarND-Term2-UKF
This repository holds the solution for the Udacity Self Driving Car Engineer Term 2 assignment to build an Unscented Kalman Filter for using fused radar and lidar data to predict vehicle location.

It uses the simulator provided by Udacity Term 2, not included here.

Note this repository does not contain the C++ Eigen source code, but all other files from the Udacity git repo (including the built Eigen libraries) were copied into this repo so it should be self-contained unless those Eigen src files are required.  They are available publicly from the Udacity Self Driving Car Engineer Term 2 Extended Kalman Filter repository (as well as other places).
